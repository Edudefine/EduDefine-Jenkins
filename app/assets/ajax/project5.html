				TagTik is powered by Internet of Things. It uses a proprietary patent pending technology to detect movement and automatic attendance. It is even smart to detect, if a child carries more than one ID card  or if a child is nearing a unsafe zone and gives a alert to the right people to take necessary action.
			</p>
			<h4>Attendance</h4>
			<p>
				Walk with-in 30 to 50 feet of TagTik Satellites, it can detect, if you are entering or exiting the campus and can inform the right people automatically.
			</p>

			<h4>Security</h4>
			<p>
				Keep certain zones safe and secure. TagTik Satellite modules can alert (sound or notification) when children get closer to say Pool, Terrace, Genset, Well, Bushes etc.
			</p>
			<h4>Location</h4>
			<p>
				TagTik Satellite when arranged in grids/rooms, can co-ordinate and locate children online. You can even browse to a point of time, to see who were around the place at a given point of time.
			</p>
			<h4>Apps</h4>

				Bus Admin can find out who is present in the bus, who is absent (even alert if the child is marked present in school but missing in the bus) on a single click. We have an app for classroom too.
